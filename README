This is a backport of the RHEL7 kernel to RHEL6. Well, sort-of a backport.
It's the RHEL7 kernel extracted and repackaged for RHEL6. There's nothing
complex here, just extracting, moving a few things around, adding a few
symlinks (to help with poorly designed software/people), and generating new
RPMs.

This "backported" kernel seems to work great for allowing the latest
version of docker (tested up through 1.10.3) work on RHEL6.

The spec file is based on the spec file provided by the "elrepo" project,
with adjustments, and stripped down to remove parts we don't need (like
NOPAE kernels).

To build:
  $ ./build

...and/or copy the appropriate bits (the el7 *.rpm files and the spec file)
into your normal rpmbuild directory tree in appropriate places.

To update to latest kernel: Snag the latest kernel RPMs from CentOS 7 and
drop them in this directory, and update the RHKrel define in the spec file.
