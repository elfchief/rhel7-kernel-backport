This is a backport of the CentOS 7 kernel to CentOS 6. Well, sort-of a
backport. It's the RHEL7 kernel extracted and repackaged for RHEL6. There's
nothing complex here, just extracting, moving a few things around, adding
a few symlinks (to help with poorly designed software/people), and generating
new RPMs. You still get the advantages of a supported & tested kernel, since
the kernel binaries are used verbatim from the CentOS 7 binary RPMs.

This "backported" kernel seems to work great for allowing the latest
version of docker (tested up through 1.10.3) work on CentOS 6.

The spec file is based on the spec file provided by the "elrepo" project,
with adjustments, and stripped down to remove parts we don't need (like
NOPAE kernels).

To build:
  $ ./build

...and/or copy the appropriate bits (the el7 *.rpm files and the spec file)
into your normal rpmbuild directory tree in appropriate places.

To update to latest kernel: Snag the latest kernel RPMs from CentOS 7 and
drop them in this directory, and update the RHKrel define in the spec file.
